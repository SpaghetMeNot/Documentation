# Install uvProject
!!! note "RECOMMENDED BLENDER 4.1+ REQUIRES BLENDER 4.0+"

## Asset Library
uvProject is installed as an asset library. (The implementation is 100% Geometry Nodes)


1. Download latest .zip file for the appropriate Blender version. (e.g. for Blender 4.1 use "4_1_xxxx.zip")

2. Unzip/extract folder to your desired location

3. Open Blender and go to **Edit/Preferences/File Paths/Asset Libraries**

4. Click + Add Asset Library
    ![install1](assets/install1.webp)

5. Navigate to the unzipped folder and press Add Asset Library. (Make sure you are in the "uvProject" Folder)
    ![install2](assets/install2.webp)

6. Save Preferences and restart Blender for modifiers/tools to show up in menus

## Alternative Catalog
By default, the assets are organized into generic categories to make using them feel more native within Blender. 

I've included an alternate catalog that groups everything under a "SpaghetMeNot" catalog to keep all my nodes together. This may be preferable if you have lots of node asset libraries. 

To use this simply replace blender_assets.cats.txt with the version found inside the Grouped SpaghetMeNot Catalog Folder:

![catalog1](assets/catalog1.webp)
